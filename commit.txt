Use this to play with different commit messages

[Subject]
Subjects for commits should be under 50 characters, but can be up to 72
Github even warns you above the 50 character limit but truncates subjects over 72

Don't forget to capitalize the subject line and dont end with a period!

Subject line should be written in the imperative, so it should read like a instruction
eg
- Fix launch bug
- Remove boilerplate code

Simple rule to get it right
A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence
"If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>"

Only needed for subject not the body

[Body]
Commit body's should wrap at 72 characters as well for readibility

Know what 72 characters looks like? It's more than I thought it would.." | wc -c = 72 (I know I cheated with the double period)

Body should explain what and why not the how as the code shows the how
